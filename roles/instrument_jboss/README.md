# AppDynamics role to instrument Jboss/Wildfly

This role features:

- java-agent installation for Linux
- instrumentation of Jboss/Wildfly
- automatic applications restart (if systemd service is present)
- java agent start verification

Example 1: Install java-agent and instrument one or more applications.

```yml
---
- hosts: all
  tasks:
    - name: Include variables for the controller settings
      include_vars: vars/controller.yaml
    - include_role:
        name: appdynamics.agents.java
        # use java role variables in the following instrumentation tasks when public: yes
        public: yes
      vars:
        agent_version: 21.11.4
        agent_type: java8

    - include_role:
        name: appdynamics.agents.instrument_jboss
      vars:
        # instrument jboss:
        application_name: "IoT_API2"
        tier_name: "Jboss"
        jboss_service: wildfly
        app_user: wildfly
        restart_app: yes
        jboss_config: /opt/wildfly/bin/standalone.sh
```

Example 2: To make sure all instrumented applications can have access to java-agent logs directory, this role creates `appdynamics` functional user/group to own java-agent dir and then assigns applications PID users to `appdynamics` group.
In some cases, when application PID user is not local on linux host (i.e. from external source) it cannot be added to the `appdynamics` group. In such case you can let application user to own java-agent directory instead.

    - include_role:

        # use java role variables in the following instrumentation tasks when public: yes
        public: yes
      vars:
        agent_version: 21.11.4
        agent_type: java8
        # single app mode: Can skip appdynamics user creation and own java-agent directory by app user (wildfly in this case)
        create_appdynamics_user: no
        agent_dir_permission:
          user:  wildfly
          group: wildfly
    - include_role:
        name: appdynamics.agents.instrument_jboss
      vars:
        # instrument jboss:
        application_name: "IoT_API2"
        tier_name: "Jboss"
        jboss_service: wildfly
        app_user: wildfly
        restart_app: yes
        jboss_config: /opt/wildfly/bin/standalone.sh
```
